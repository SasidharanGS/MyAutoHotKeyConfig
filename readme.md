** What this is: **
This Autohotkey (.ahk) file contains all the shortcuts I set up in windows to get functionality in-line with my linux install.

1. Toggle Hotkey functionality
2. Open specified folder on "win+e"
3. Open Bitwarden
4. Open Vivaldi
5. Open Firefox
6. Open control panel
7. Open VS-code
8. Close windows with "alt+4" instead of "alt+F4" (useful when the function row is set to special functions)
9. Middle click to paste
10. Google search any selected string
11. Open (folder) context sensitive Terminal

(Modify application locations (and applications) for 3,4,5,7 in accordance with your system for them to work as intended)
